    API is an acronym that stands for <b>A</b>pplication <b>P</b>rogamming <b>I</b>nterface.
    I don't know about you but I am someone who needs examples of what I am trying to learn in a way that relates to something
    that is easier to grasp. 
    <br>
    Think of API's at a bakery. This bakery makes everything in house! You are looking at the menu for something that you want. There are a ton of choices 
    and options for you to chose from. You order, and the bakery hands over your freshly baked dessert. You don't put much thought into
    how they make their desserts but you are just happy with your choice. You are happy you can just go to the bakery to 
    get what you want, or sometimes need, instead of baking them yourself. 
    <br> This is how API's work, it makes your job, as a developer, easier because you don't have to code everything nor 
    do you have to know how it fully works to use it. You can just call it to use it. API's are made so developers
    don't have to recreate the same code over and over. When people talk about API's, they tend to talk about Web API's.

    <h2 class ="cover-heading">REST
    </h2>
    //FILL HERE!!!!!!
    <p>
       REST stands for <b>RE</b>presentational <b>S</b>tate <b>T</b>ransfer.
       It is a design patter for API's.
       It has 6 constraints in order for interfaces to be restful.
       1. Uniform interface
       2. Client-Sever 
       3. Stateless
       4. Layered system
       5. Cacheable
       6. Code on demand 
        When an API is restful its when a server will show(transfer) the state of what you requested.
        Let's say you sign up for Instagram or Twitter. Your username is now
        associated with a link to your profile. If you go to the website / your username 
        the GET method shows that you are trying to get that user. The username is your identifier and no one else can have that identifier.

    <h2 class ="cover-heading">What Is Postman And Why Use It? </h2>
    //FILL HERE!!!!!!
    <p>
       Postman is a software that is for API development. This is used between
       developers to make, test and adjust API's. This software makes API advancement easy and efficient.
       Postman allows developers to do HTTP requests in different languages in a place
       where developers can save their work.   
       Postman is primarly used to send and recieve requests.
