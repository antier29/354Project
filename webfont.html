  <h2 class ="cover-heading">Mitt Romney Web Font Problem</h2>
    <br>

    
    <p>The issue that occurred is a website had an article that states that Mitt Romney is NOT running for president. But the big issue is that the word “not” compared to the other ones in this headline were in different fonts. because the word “not” was a different font it took longer for it to load on the users screen. This caused the headline title to say the opposite of its original meaning. It showed that Romney was running for president. The name behind the reason this text was not loading is called FOIT or flash of invisible text. This is when you use different weights and styles in the same typeface. 
        <br><br>Now discussing fonts isn’t an average persons conversation topic but this issue is a pretty big deal because it can drastically change the meaning of said articles. This can affect any website regardless of its details. Some people tend to just read headlines and skim though the actual article. If they see one thing then go on to read another this causes unnecessary confusion. Browsers should be the first line in fixing this issue as it is their job to load the fonts. This will also save developers time in fixing this. It is a lot easier for a browser to fix it than every single web developer to go in and alter their code for every website page they created. 
       <br> <br>Fonts are typically overlooked when it comes to development but its is essential to the readability and impression it makes for the user. Choosing the correct font will make your website not only look credible and polished but easier to read across all platforms. Since multiple fonts are used in websites, a FOIT issue could possibly be detrimental to the information you are trying to give your users. Browsers should change the way they load and render the fonts so this issue doesn’t occur.
