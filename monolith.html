    <br>

    
    <p> 
    It seems that many companies are switching from Monolith to Microservices.
    While monolith is a somewhat of a standard default for software
    application it still has its own issues. Micorservices offer many advantages
    but is it the best, most efficiant choice to convert over to?
    </p>

    <h2>Monolithic Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        This type of application is built as one single unit. This 
        is the orginal way of building them. It is composed of a client-side
        user interface, serverside application and a database. 
        This simply means HTML and/or JavaScript pages, tables for a database
        management system and HTTP requests. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Monolithic applications are coded in one large unit. This way if changes
        are needed they, the developers, will update it as a whole. Now this does have a downside
        as it has to be executed very meticulously becasue the entire piece is being changed. This 
        could take the developmental process to be prolonged.  
    
        Even though changes can take longer, a Monolithic application is a lot easier 
        to debugg and test. End-to-end testing will be much faster compared to a Microservice architecture.
        Not only will it be easier to deploy because of a single file, it is also easier 
        to create. Even though it is a one application, it is hard to manage 
        as it is very large and convoluted. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Micorservices Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        This type of architecture is complied of smaller components. 
        Each component processes as an independent entity. All parts can be 
        deployed and updated on its own. Although each 
        part is divided and simplier to comprehend, it makes debugging harder 
        to do because of the seperate parts as well as the multiple connections from modules to databases.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>So Which is better?</h2>
    <p>
        If you have a larger more convoluted company then Microservices will be the better option. 
        It will need a team that is well versed in how to implement this type of architecture.
        If your business is just starting out and have a simplier application then a Monolith approach would be best suited
        for you since it will be easier to build and deploy.
