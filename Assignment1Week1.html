<h2>Values and Types</h2>


<h4>Strings</h4>
<p>Strings can be written in 3 different ways</p>
<pre>
var str1 = "Double quotes"
var str2 = 'Single quotes'
var str3 = `Backticks`
</pre>
</div> <!-- section 1 -->

<div class="sectionSeperation">
<h4>Numbers</h4>
<p>Javascript supports scientific notation</p>
<br>
<pre>
2.998e8 will be written as 299800000
2.998e-3 will be written as 0.002998
</pre>
<p>Infinity &infin; and Negative Infinity - &infin; are used to know if you have
  gone higher or lower than the largest possible number in Javascript.
  That number is 1.797693131348623157e+308. Now that's a big number!</p>
</div> <!-- section 2 -->
<br>

<div class="sectionSeperation">
<h2> Unary Operators </h2>

<h4>Typeof</h4>
<p>This is used for debugging purposes or when you have data that changes periodiclly.</p>

<pre>
  typeof 9.3 will give you a number result<br>
  typeof " " will give you a string<br>
  typeof {} will give you a string
</pre>

<br>
<h4>Plus, Negative and Logical Not </h4>
<p> The plus sign ( + ), converts strings of numbers, booleans and null's to numbers.
  The negative sign ( - ) does the exact same thing but negates it. </p>

  <pre>
    + 50 and + '50' will give the result of 50.
    <br>
    + '-50' will give the result of -50.
    <br>
    if you use the negative sign...
    <br>
    - 50 will give you -50
    <br>
    - '-50' will give you 50.
    <br>
  </pre>
    <p>True will give you a result of 1 and null will give you a result of 0.
    So if you were to negate them, you would get -1 and -0. Yes I said -0! It is
    a weird thing to see but just think of it as any other number.</p>
<br>

<h4>Delete </h4>
<p>You can use the delete operator to remove a property from an object.</p>
<pre>
  var myObj = {Major: “WebDevelopment”};
	delete myObj.major
	   >This will return true bc property is deleted


	delete myObj.minor
	  >This will also return true bc it doesn’t exist
</pre>
</div> <!-- section 3 -->

<div class="sectionSeperation">
<h2>Hoisting</h2>
<p>Hoisting is when a browser/engine compiles variables and named-functions immediately.You are bringing them
  to the top of the file.
  When Javascript compiles all of your code, all var declarations
  are hoisted/lifted to the top of their functional/local scope
  of an inside function or to the top of their global scope
if its an outside function regardless of where the actual declaration has been made. </p>
